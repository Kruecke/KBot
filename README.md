Starcraft Bot (using BWAPI)

    Test change for deployment!

# Build
- Change the path in `StarcraftPath.props` to match your installation of Starcraft Broodwar.
- The solution file is for Visual Studio 2017, but you need the Visual Studio 2013 Platform Toolset (v120) for building.

# SSCAIT
KBot is running on SSCAIT as well. [Vote](http://sscaitournament.com/index.php?action=voteForPlayers&botId=384) for it to see it play on [Stream](https://www.twitch.tv/sscait). :)
