# Build with Visual Studio
- Change the path in `StarcraftPath.props` to match your installation of Starcraft Broodwar.
- Run `build.sh` from VS 2017 Command Prompt to build BWAPI and KBot for debug and release.

# SSCAIT
KBot is running on SSCAIT as well. [Vote](http://sscaitournament.com/index.php?action=voteForPlayers&botId=384) for it to see it play on [Stream](https://www.twitch.tv/sscait). :)
